# Practical A/B Testing in Machine Learning with Python


## Overview

This repository contains a practical Jupyter Notebook, **"Practical AB Testing in Machine Learning with Python"**, which demonstrates how to perform A/B testing in various machine learning workflows. The notebook includes hands-on examples that cover:

- **Feature Engineering A/B Testing:** Evaluating the impact of different feature sets.
- **Model Selection A/B Testing:** Comparing different ML models on the same dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning A/B Testing:** Assessing improvements from hyperparameter optimization.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Using paired t-tests (and explanations of independent tests) to ensure performance differences are statistically significant.
